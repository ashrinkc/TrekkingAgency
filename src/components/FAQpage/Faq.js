              Unlike backpacking, when on a trek you will only be required to
              carry those items needed for the day of walking. All of the group
              personal gear and camping equipment is carried by a trained group
              of porters or pack animals (ponies, yaks, llama, camelsâ€¦)

            </div>
            <p>
              Depending on the trip, you will be accompanied by an experienced
              Western trekking guide and / or an English-speaking professional
              local guide. In addition, each group will have a local kitchen
              staff and support crew.
